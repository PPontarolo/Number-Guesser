# Number-Guesser

These are fun little projects that I randomly think of and start working on. they are for me to refresh my knowledge of Python.

## Craigs 

My goal is to try to have Craig Guess the users number with the least number of guesses. Craig uses a random number to make a guess that is between 1-1000

### Craig.py
Give Craig a number and Craig will try to guess the number that the user gives. </br>
    -This version of Craig is all base on luck and random nurmbers with narrowing down his range. </br>
        -when Craig guesses, it is compared to the users number and sees if it is higher or lower. If it is higher or lower than the users number Craig will change his range to his guess plus 1. </br>
            -EX: craig guesses 345. Users number is 543. Craigs number is lower than the users. Craig changes his range from 1-1000 to 346-1000</br>
    -His average guess 12.5 out of 10 trys. 7-18 guesses range </br>

## User Guess

User Guess.py
The user makes a guess. it will count the number of guesses through recurance.
