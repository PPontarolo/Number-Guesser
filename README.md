# Number-Guesser

These are fun little projects that I randomly think of and start working on. they are for me to refresh my knowledge of Python.

Craig.py
Give Craig a number and Craig will try to guess the number that the user gives. 

User Guess.py
The user makes a guess. it will count the number of guesses through recurance.
